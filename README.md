# cs50W - Network

My take on **cs50W - Network (project 4)** [requirements here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/network/)

It is a social-media like web application in Django and JavaScript with the following specifications:

 - Users that are logged in should be able to create new posts
 - There needs to be an url for **All posts**
 - Implementation of a **Profile page** where all the posts of that user are listed, with follow/unfollow functionality
 - **Following** where you can see all the posts of the followed users
 - Any page that displays posts should use pagination - 10 posts per page
 - Users should be able to edit their posts **without** reloading the page (this is where the JavaScript part comes in)
 - **Like and Unlike** - this too should be implemented using JavaScript without reloading the page; the content must be updated dynamically

## Final words
The project is hard - hardest so far. For me, without any prior knowledge of Javascript, the JS course on FreeCodeCamp was a good place to start. To the final project!
